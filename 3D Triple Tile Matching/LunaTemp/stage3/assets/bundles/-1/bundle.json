A lot of errors will appear but don't worry\r\n2) Close and reopen Unity (and your project). This is fundamental: skipping this step will cause a bloodbath\r\n3) Open DOTween's Utility Panel (Tools > Demigiant > DOTween Utility Panel) if it doesn't open automatically, then press \"Setup DOTween...\": this will run the upgrade setup\r\n4) From the Add/Remove Modules panel that opens, activate/deactivate Modules for Unity systems and for external assets (Pro version only)\r\n\r\n// GET STARTED //////////////////////////////////////////////\r\n\r\n- After importing a new DOTween update, select DOTween's Utility Panel from the \"Tools/Demigiant\" menu (if it doesn't open automatically) and press the \"Setup DOTween...\" button to activate/deactivate Modules. You can also access a Preferences Tab from there to choose default settings for DOTween.\r\n- In your code, add \"using DG.Tweening\" to each class where you want to use DOTween.\r\n- You're ready to tween.
